# SRNet
A pytorch implementation of the SRNet architecture from the paper Editing text in the wild (Liang Wu et al.)

Original tensorflow implementation: https://github.com/youdao-ai/SRNet
This implementation includes a few changes to the discriminator, datagenerator and the training process.  

Final Srnet code pushed. Training is even more stable. Another addition is that this repo sets up the entire dataset for you and helps you train by running just two scripts. Instructions of usage to follow in README.

TO DO:

1) Final README
2) SRNet Demo upload 

Expected by 30th June 2020
